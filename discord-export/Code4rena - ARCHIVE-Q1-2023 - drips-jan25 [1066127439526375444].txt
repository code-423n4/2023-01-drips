hey @xmxanuel , could you explain!!, in docs it says in Splitting section that `All the list entries must add up to no more than 100%, in which case the receiving user won't get any funds, and will transfer all received funds to others`, are others it mean by under 0-200 entries ?, and Is there any another way by which receiver can be fund if he end up listing out of 200?


[01/26/2023 08:43] igorzuk
Hi @eyexploit,
> are others it mean by under 0-200 entries ?,
I'm not sure if I understand your question, correct me if I'm wrong. The "others" who will receive funds split by you are the users on the list. Examples:
- your list is `user 1: 100%`: user1 will get 100% of funds you split, you'll get 0%
- your list is `user1: 20%`: user1 will get 20% and you will get 80%.
- your list is `user1: 30%, user2: 70%`: user 1 will get 30%, user2 70%, you will get 0%
- your list is `user1: 15%, user2: 21%`: user 1 will get 15%, user2 21%, you will get 64%
- your list is `user1: 90%, user2: 11%`: invalid, adds up to more than 100%
- your list is a list of 200 users, each of them getting 0.05%: the users on the list get 10% in total, you get 90%
- your list is a list of 201 users: invalid, list too long
The limitation of 200 splits receivers is purely a gas limitation. If the block gas limit was twice as high, the limit would be probably 400.

> Is there any another way by which receiver can be fund if he end up listing out of 200?
It doesn't matter how **many** splits receivers the user has set up, but how **many percent** that user is splitting to others. If they split 100%, there's no way to force them to accept your funds into their wallet, everything will be split and given away. This is useful in cases like dummy users implementing "awesome lists", e.g. a user advertised as "10 awesome FOSS projects", who splits 100% to 10 said projects. You can then drip, split or give to that dummy user and your funds will support the 10 projects (eventually).

hi , I can't understand purpose of the following line of code in _setDrip function , Can someone explain  ?


[01/26/2023 18:32] mahdi9606
if (realBalanceDelta < -currBalance) {
                realBalanceDelta = -currBalance;
            }


[01/26/2023 19:32] xmxanuel
hey @mahdikarimi


[01/26/2023 19:38] xmxanuel
The Code is dealing with the following. We have one variable which indicates if you want to topUp or withdraw funds from a sender configuration. 

`balanceDelta` => negative means the sender wants to withdraw funds.

For example if you want to withdraw `-100` Dai but your actual `currBalance` is only `80 Dai`. The `realBalanceDelta` should be `-80 Dai`. Because it is not possible to withdraw the full 100 Dai. This part of handles this case.

If you look at this PR we are discussing these lines of code with some examples
https://github.com/radicle-dev/drips-contracts/pull/232


[01/26/2023 19:44] xmxanuel
```solidity
  realBalanceDelta = balanceDelta;
  // Cap `realBalanceDelta` at withdrawal of the entire `currBalance`
  if (realBalanceDelta < -currBalance) {
      realBalanceDelta = -currBalance;
  }
```
My example:
```
realBalanceDelta = -100
if(-100 < -80) {
   realBalanceDelta = -80
}
```
(Doing it in this way is a bit counterintuitive but allowed the removal of some local helper variables as discussed in the PR)

what is difference between userid and receivers in _setDrip ?


[01/26/2023 21:15] mahdi9606
userid isn't id of the user that receives drips ?


[01/26/2023 21:23] xmxanuel
@mahdikarimi  In the _`setDrips` function the userId is the sender's userId


[01/26/2023 21:24] xmxanuel
one sender can send to multiple different receivers


[01/27/2023 12:59] mahdi9606
I mean the userid is id of sender or receiver ?


[01/27/2023 13:00] igorzuk
The sender


[01/27/2023 13:02] mahdi9606
So every drip stores configuration of both receiving and streaming funds for a user right ?


[01/27/2023 13:02] igorzuk
What do you mean by "a drip stores"? There are a few places you could be referenceing


[01/27/2023 13:03] mahdi9606
dripstate i mean


[01/27/2023 13:04] igorzuk
The result of `function dripsState(uint256 userId, IERC20 erc20)`, right? It returns the hash of the drips configuration of the user acting as a sender, it's a hash of the list of their receivers.


[01/27/2023 13:06] mahdi9606
DripsState storage state = _dripsStorage().states[assetId][userId];


[01/27/2023 13:08] mahdi9606
in _receiveDripsResult


[01/27/2023 13:08] igorzuk
Ah, sorry about the confusion üòÑ
It's both:


[01/27/2023 13:08] igorzuk
```solidity
struct DripsState {
    bytes32 dripsHistoryHash; // sender
    mapping(uint256 => uint32[2 ** 32]) nextSqueezed;  // sender
    bytes32 dripsHash; // sender
    uint32 nextReceivableCycle; // receiver
    uint32 updateTime; // sender
    uint32 maxEnd; // sender
    uint128 balance; // sender
    uint32 currCycleConfigs; // sender
    mapping(uint32 => AmtDelta) amtDeltas; // receiver
}
```


[01/27/2023 13:09] xmxanuel
A user can be a sender and receiver. The DripsState contains information about both


[01/27/2023 13:10] mahdi9606

[01/27/2023 15:29] patrickalphac
So with the `ImmutableSplitsDriver` , it's not the intention for someone setting up splits through that driver to also set up a drip? 

ie: I want to set up a drip that uses that split I just created. There weren't any tests in `ImmutableSplitsDriver.t.sol` for sending or collecting payments using this driver. 

So... looks like someone else would be able to `setDrips` with the userId of the `ImmutableSplitsDriver`. 

I think I just talked myself into the answer. But just for clarity. The `ImmutableSplitsDriver` is intended to not setup drips yes? It can only be sent drips.

{Reactions}
üëç 

[01/27/2023 15:55] igorzuk
Yes, `ImmutableSplitsDriver` can't be used as a drips sender, it can only receive and then split 100% to others

{Reactions}
üëç 

[01/27/2023 15:55] igorzuk
That's why it can't even `collect`, there's supposed to be nothing to collect.


[01/27/2023 15:56] igorzuk
I don't think that `ImmutableSplitsDriver` will ever be able to set up drips, it doesn't seem useful.


[01/27/2023 15:59] xmxanuel
The call to public method `DripsHub.split()` will trigger the forwarding for an `ImmutableSplit`

Hi @menox,
Each driver can call `updateDriverAddress` on `DripsHub` to update the address controlling their driver ID. Our drivers don't need this, because they are upgradeable and we don't want to change their addresses, but if you write your own driver, you could implement a migration feature, which would transfer the driver ID to be controlled by a new address.

how to understand this sentence? "// If the last update was not in the current cycle,
            // there's only the single latest history entry to squeeze in the current cycle."


[01/30/2023 20:11] xmxanuel
Hi @chaduke,

maybe it is the easiest with an example.  Imagine a cycle is 1 week.  I could stream to you since 10 weeks and might have changed the `amtPerSec` multiple times. 

However, for squeezing it is only relevant, how often it has changed in the current cycle.  If I never changed my config in the current cycle the latest history entry (current config) is the only relevant one.

No, it's unlimited.


[01/31/2023 12:55] 0xpathfindr
And each pause is isolated to a particular Drip Contract correct?


[01/31/2023 12:56] igorzuk
Yes, each `Managed` contract has a separate admin and a separate set of pausers.


[01/31/2023 12:57] igorzuk
This makes management of the entire ecosystem more cumbersome, but also more fine grained and more transparent.


[01/31/2023 12:58] 0xpathfindr

How long will cycles be in production? 10 seconds?


[01/31/2023 20:06] xmxanuel
It is a trade-off. If it would be 10 seconds and a receiver wouldn't collect their stream for over a year. The gas-costs would be very high. We most likely will choose something like a `1 week`.  The `squeezeDrips` feature allows to receiveDrips with per second precision.

Some big number math that someone else might find useful/interesting...


[02/02/2023 02:38] Aeros#7185
Splits and Drips can keep track of at most `type(uint128).max` of each asset. My immediate thought was "is it possible to overflow this?"


[02/02/2023 02:39] Aeros#7185
The long and the short of it is: NO. It's highly implausible. As far as I can tell, SHIBA INU is the token with the highest token supply cap of all ERC20 tokens, with a max supply of 999 nonillion, 990 octillion, 968 septillion, ... which we can round to 1 decillion.


[02/02/2023 02:40] Aeros#7185
`type(uint128).max` = 340 undecillion, 282 decillion, 366 nonillion, ... ~ 340,282 decillion


[02/02/2023 02:42] Aeros#7185
So even if you had the entire max circulating supply of the highest supply cap ERC20 token and put all of it into Splits/Drips you'd still be only about 1/340,282th of the way to hitting the max value.

If any of the math here doesn't check out let me know


[02/02/2023 08:39] xmxanuel
As @IgorZuk already mentioned we will most likely deploy one version. However, I just wanted to mention a very low `cycleSecs` would have impact on the precision we support with `AMT_PER_SEC_MULTIPLIER` .  The trade-off is not only about gas-costs vs. getting funds earlier. 

If the `cycleSecs=1` we effective would lose completely the precision. Which we need for tokens like `USDC` .  (10^6 precision). 

```
 int256 fullCycle = (int256(uint256(_cycleSecs)) * amtPerSec) / amtPerSecMultiplier;
```

It would mean the lowest technical possible `amtPerSec` would be `0.000001 USDC`. Which would be `~2.592 USDC` per month. (We obviously also want to support lower amtPerSecs for USDC)


[02/02/2023 08:43] igorzuk
We also check it in DripsHub, just to be sure üôÇ It doesn't let in more than `type(int128).max` of any asset.

Seaport 1.2 was, to me, as clean as this. But yes, very clean, kudos to the devs and project auditors

Really enjoyed reading this one, too. Great balance of old school simplicity, advanced stuff like unstructured storage and offchain data hashing, and readability. :chefskiss:  I'm gonna point to Drips as an example for some of these patterns!

A huge thank you to all the wardens who put their time and effort into reviewing our codebase! Congratulations to all the award winners, these were great findings, especially @evan and @HollaDieWaldfee, that bug was an incredible catch! Thank you to all the judges for moderation, reviewing and a **very** deep analysis of the filings when weighting them, you've done tremendous work! I can't recommend C4 enough, that was a wild ride üî•

@Jay | C4  I've just had the time to review my submissions and it appears my GO report was graded unsatisfactory simple because it did not save sufficient gas (8 minor savings for +-300 gas).

I have no issue with this, but I was not aware of a minimum gas saved requirement for the GO report and I cannot find any reference to this in the documentation. 

Is this contest specific? Is it communicated somewhere?
